initialization
  { This initialization section configures:
    - Application.OnInitialize
    - Application.MainWindow
    - determines initial window size

    You should not need to do anything more in this initialization section.
    Most of your actual application initialization (in particular, any file reading)
    should happen inside ApplicationInitialize. }
